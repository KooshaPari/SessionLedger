# Functional requirements — SessionLedger

Machine-readable FR catalog for agent readiness (C03 / v38). Derived from
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md). Each FR has a stable
ID, status, and acceptance references (tests and/or API surfaces).

Status vocabulary matches the ops traceability SSOT: `done`, `partial`, `todo`,
`blocked`, or `na`.

Roles used in stories: **operator** (runs local daemon/ops), **developer**
(integrates ingest/compile/inject), **viewer-user** (uses the desktop viewer).

## User stories (role form)

| ID | Story |
|----|-------|
| FR-001 | As a developer, I want JSONL and corpus transcripts ingested into a normalized Session so that every source shares one model for distill and export. |
| FR-002 | As an operator, I want OKF bundle schema validation on ingest so that invalid payloads are rejected before they enter the store. |
| FR-003 | As a viewer-user, I want to list and search/filter bundles so that I can find sessions by time, model, tokens, and tags. |
| FR-004 | As a viewer-user, I want session replay over SSE so that I can stream events without loading the full transcript up front. |
| FR-005 | As an operator, I want aggregated session metrics so that I can see bundle volume, models, and token usage at a glance. |
| FR-006 | As an operator, I want gzip archive and restore so that old bundles can be compacted and recovered later. |
| FR-007 | As a viewer-user, I want a Timeline view so that I can browse session history chronologically. |
| FR-008 | As a viewer-user, I want Search in the viewer so that I can query sessions without leaving the UI. |
| FR-009 | As a viewer-user, I want Replay in the viewer so that I can watch a selected bundle stream from the daemon. |
| FR-010 | As a viewer-user, I want a LiveFeed so that newly emitted OKF paths appear as the daemon processes work. |
| FR-011 | As a developer, I want unfinished and crash-recovery surfaces so that I can resume the next recoverable unit of work. |
| FR-012 | As a developer, I want ContinuationBundle compile with an inject gate so that only acceptance-complete bundles become injectable prompts. |
| FR-013 | As a developer, I want an OKF roundtrip smoke path so that the JSONL→daemon→OKF→viewer contract stays proven. |
| FR-014 | As an operator, I want daemon liveness and a local ops stack so that healthz/readyz and `make dev` keep the system runnable. |
| FR-015 | As an operator, I want observability surfaces so that metrics, optional OTLP traces, and dashboards show daemon health. |

## API surface (daemon)

| Method | Path | FR |
|--------|------|----|
| GET | `/healthz` | FR-014 |
| GET | `/api/bundles` | FR-003 |
| GET | `/api/search` | FR-003, FR-008 |
| GET | `/api/stream` | FR-010 |
| GET | `/api/replay/:id` | FR-004, FR-009 |
| POST | `/api/ingest` | FR-002 |
| GET | `/api/metrics` | FR-005, FR-015 |

Default listen: `SL_PORT=8080` (see `process-compose.yaml`).

## Notes

- FR-011 is complete: T-024 classifies normalized sessions and serializes
  `WorklogProjection` items; T-036 displays them in the viewer's unfinished tab.
- FR-015 is complete at its FR scope: structured traces, feature-gated OTLP
  export, Prometheus RED metrics, and an importable dashboard are shipped.
  Provisioning, alert routing, endpoint labels, and histogram depth remain C05
  audit gaps in `ops/GAP_QA_MATRIX.md`, not unfinished FR acceptance.
