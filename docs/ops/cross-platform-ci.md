# Cross-Platform CI Acceptance

SessionLedger PR CI is intentionally Linux-only. The default pull request
workflows run on `ubuntu-latest` because Phenotype billing policy does not allow
macOS or Windows runners for routine PR validation.

The authoritative cross-platform acceptance gate is the tag-driven release
workflow: [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml).
A release is acceptable only when that workflow's platform matrix and dependent
smoke jobs pass.

## Release Matrix

The release build matrix must continue to include these runner families:

| Platform | Runner | Target or artifact |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| Linux | `ubuntu-latest` | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| macOS | `macos-latest` | `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows | `windows-latest` | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, Windows MSI scaffold |

Published release artifacts:

| Artifact | Produced by |
|----------|-------------|
| `sl-viewer-<tag>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` | Linux release build |
| `sl-viewer-<tag>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | macOS Intel release build |
| `sl-viewer-<tag>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | macOS Apple Silicon release build |
| `sl-viewer-<tag>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` | Windows release build |
| `sl-viewer-<tag>-windows-msi-scaffold.zip` | Windows WiX source and build notes |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Release checksum step |
| `session-ledger.cdx.json` | CycloneDX SBOM step |
| `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json` | Best-effort keyless checksum signature |
| `ghcr.io/kooshapari/sl-daemon:<tag>` | Best-effort OCI build + keyless cosign + attestation |

## Acceptance Jobs

`release.yml` contains these cross-platform acceptance jobs:

| Job | Runner | Acceptance signal |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| `build` | Matrix from `release.yml` | Builds and uploads each platform archive |
| `smoke-linux` | `ubuntu-latest` | Downloads the Linux artifact, extracts it, and runs `sl-viewer --version` |
| `smoke-windows` | `windows-latest` | Downloads the Windows artifact, extracts it, and runs `sl-viewer.exe --version` |
| `release` | `ubuntu-latest` | Publishes only after build plus Linux and Windows smoke jobs pass |
| `sign-checksums` | `ubuntu-latest` | Attempts keyless checksum signing after publication |
| `oci-image` | `ubuntu-latest` | Best-effort GHCR build/push + cosign sign + OCI attestation (soft-fail) |

macOS acceptance is a release-build acceptance signal today. Linux and Windows
also have release-artifact execution smokes before publication.

## PR Guard

The lightweight
[`.github/workflows/cross-platform-smoke.yml`](../../.github/workflows/cross-platform-smoke.yml)
workflow runs only on `ubuntu-latest`. It does not download or execute macOS or
Windows artifacts. Its purpose is to parse `release.yml` and fail if the release
matrix no longer contains `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest`.

[`.github/workflows/race-smoke.yml`](../../.github/workflows/race-smoke.yml)
runs the threaded merge/OKF smoke (`tests/race_smoke.rs`) and the loom-lite
bounded-channel / cancel model (`tests/race_model.rs`) on `ubuntu-latest`,
`windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` with three repeats per runner. That gives
affordable PR coverage for concurrency determinism across host families without
executing release artifacts on every pull request. Operator notes live in
[`concurrency-safety.md`](concurrency-safety.md).

That guard keeps PR CI affordable while preventing accidental loss of the
release matrix that provides cross-platform proof.

## Default PR build-test

[`.github/workflows/cross-platform-build.yml`](../../.github/workflows/cross-platform-build.yml)
runs affordable `cargo build --locked` checks for the root workspace and the
isolated `sl-daemon` workspace on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and
`macos-latest`. This complements the Linux-only `build-test` job in `ci.yml`
without executing the full test matrix on every host family.
