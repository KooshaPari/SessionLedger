# Compression Evaluation Gate

This gate records shallow evidence that SessionLedger's zstd adapter reduces
representative OKF sessions (including compression/token-oriented conformance
fixtures) while preserving byte-for-byte round trips and a coarse token-burn
proxy.

## Method

Run the feature-gated integration test:

```sh
cargo test -p session-ledger --features compress --test compression_eval --locked
```

The test loads a small CI set of OKF fixtures (baseline `auth-fix` plus
token-budget / compress-resume / compress-token-proxy / token-slice-budget /
archive-gzip-resume family fixtures), compresses each with `ZstdCompressor` at
level 3, decompresses it, and asserts that the decoded text exactly matches the
fixture. It then computes:

```text
ratio_bps = compressed_bytes * 10_000 / source_bytes
bytes_saved = source_bytes - compressed_bytes
rough_tokens_saved ~= bytes_saved / 4
```

Basis points keep the assertion integer-only and stable in CI. The rough token
proxy is cross-checked against `CharCountTokenEstimator` scoring the source as
non-empty.

## Threshold

The current gate requires `ratio_bps <= 6_500`, meaning the compressed payload
must be at most 65% of the source fixture size. This is intentionally loose
enough for fixture evolution, but tight enough to catch accidental passthrough
compression, feature miswiring, or a compressor-level regression.

If a fixture changes materially, update the threshold only with a fresh local
run and include the observed compressed/source byte counts in the PR.

## Token-Burn Proxy

SessionLedger burns tokens when continuation context is injected back into an
agent. Byte savings are not a tokenizer-accurate measurement, but for JSON-like
OKF payloads they are a useful rough proxy:

```text
bytes_saved = source_bytes - compressed_bytes
rough_tokens_saved ~= bytes_saved / 4
```

The gate therefore protects a simple operational claim: smaller serialized
continuation payloads usually imply less context transferred, stored, and
eventually rehydrated into prompt material. The CI assertion is about byte
ratio plus a positive token-burn proxy; the token estimate remains a coarse
planning signal rather than a billing metric.
