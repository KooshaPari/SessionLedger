# Protected environment policy (SLSA Build L3)

Status: **C06 L53** — SSOT for **GitHub Environments** and **protected-branch**
requirements that gate release publication. This page records the **policy**,
**checklist**, and **SelfCheck** path for protected-environment evidence toward
SLSA Build Level 3. It does **not** claim full protected-environment attestation
from repository contents alone.

[`reproducible-builds.md`](reproducible-builds.md).

## Policy (GitHub Environments + protected branches)

SLSA Build Level 3 expects release builds to run in an **isolated, protected
environment** so bypassing required checks needs explicit maintainer approval.
SessionLedger's incremental path:

1. **Protected `main`** — require PR + signed commits (see
   [`branch-protection.md`](branch-protection.md)).
2. **Tag-triggered release workflow** — canonical `v*` tags on
   `KooshaPari/SessionLedger` only; forks skip OIDC/OCI with explicit reasons
   (see [`distribution.md`](distribution.md)).
3. **GitHub Environment `release`** (operator work) — create an Environment with:
   - required reviewers before deployment jobs run;
   - deployment branch rules limiting tags to `v*` (or `main` for prerelease);
   - environment-scoped secrets for publish credentials where applicable.
4. **Bind publish jobs** — add `environment: release` to blocking jobs in
   `release.yml` (`oci-image`, aggregate `release`, and any future publish slice).

This repository documents the contract and verifies in-tree anchors. Live
Environment protection rules cannot be proven from checkout without admin-scope
GitHub API access.

## What this repository can verify

| Control | Verifiable in-tree? | Evidence |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Protected-environment policy SSOT | **Yes** | This page |
| Hermetic / isolation checklist cross-link | **Yes** | [`hermetic-builds.md`](hermetic-builds.md) |
| Branch protection expectations | Partial | [`branch-protection.md`](branch-protection.md) |
| Release workflow + blocking OCI gate documented | **Yes** | `release.yml` header + `oci-image` job |
| GitHub Environment `release` wired in CI | **No** | Operator Settings + `environment:` YAML |
| Full SLSA Build L3 protected-environment attestation | **No** | Requires Environment + hardened runners + two-builder proof |

## Evidence checklist

| Gate | Status | Evidence / prerequisite |

| Protected-environment SelfCheck | **done** | `scripts/slsa-protected-env-check.ps1 -SelfCheck` |

| Release workflow + blocking `oci-image` documented | **done** | `.github/workflows/release.yml` |
| GitHub Environment `release` with required reviewers | unpaid | Settings → Environments → create `release`; add reviewers |
| `environment: release` on publish jobs | unpaid | Bind `oci-image` / aggregate `release` jobs in `release.yml` |
| Environment deployment branch / tag rules | unpaid | Limit Environment deployments to `v*` tags on canonical repo |
| Live Environment protection via GitHub API | NOT_VERIFIABLE_IN_REPO | Admin-scope `gh api` or human attestation — not asserted in soft CI |
| Full SLSA Build L3 protected-environment attestation | unpaid | Requires Environment wiring + hardened runners + independent rebuild proof |

**Policy:** Blocking CI runs the SelfCheck from `security.yml` (no
`continue-on-error`). Passing SelfCheck means docs + evidence paths stay honest —
**not** that GitHub Environments are configured or that SLSA Build Level 3 is achieved.

## SelfCheck (machine proof)

Docs + path anchors only — no cargo build, no network, no false Environment claims:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/slsa-protected-env-check.ps1 -SelfCheck
```

The script asserts:

- This page documents protected Environment + protected-branch **policy**
- Done rows stay marked **done**; unpaid rows stay documented honestly
- [`hermetic-builds.md`](hermetic-builds.md) cross-links this SSOT
- `release.yml` keeps the documented blocking `oci-image` release path
- The script does **not** claim a GitHub Environment is live from checkout

Optional `-Strict` also fails when unpaid checklist rows remain (not used in CI).
