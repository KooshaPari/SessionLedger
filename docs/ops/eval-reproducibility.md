# Eval reproducibility manifest

SessionLedger records eval surface boundaries and reproducibility anchors in
[`eval-manifest.json`](eval-manifest.json). The manifest is not a scorecard; it
binds conformance fixtures, the committed lockfile, MSRV, and the pipeline
performance baseline policy so local and CI eval runs can be compared.

## Verify

From the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/eval-repro-check.ps1
```

The script asserts:

1. `Cargo.lock` SHA-256 matches the manifest (update the manifest when the
   lockfile changes intentionally).
2. Host `rustc` meets `rust_msrv`.
3. OKF conformance fixture count matches `fixture_count`.
4. Bench policy (`perf-baseline.json`) and gate script exist.

It prints the current Git commit SHA for human correlation; the commit is
intentionally **not** pinned in the manifest because eval runs move with every
merge.

## When to update the manifest

| Change | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Cargo.lock` updated | Recompute SHA-256 and bump `cargo_lock_sha256` |
| Fixture added/removed | Bump `fixture_count` (and `fixture_seed` if corpus identity changes) |
| MSRV raised in workspace `Cargo.toml` | Bump `rust_msrv` |
| Bench policy path changes | Update `bench_policy_path` / `bench_gate_script` |

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `eval-repro-check.ps1` on every pull request
alongside the existing bench gate workflow.
