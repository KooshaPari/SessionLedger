# Viewer Hotkeys and Keyboard Navigation

Status: user-facing keyboard contract for the current `sl-viewer` surface.

## Current Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Scope | Behavior |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `?` | Whole viewer | Toggle the in-viewer keyboard help overlay (ignored while focus is in a text field). |
| **Help (?)** button | Sidebar | Open or close the same keyboard help overlay. |
| `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` | Whole viewer | Toggle the command palette (works even while focus is in a text field). |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Whole viewer | Move through the browser or WebView focus order. The active view tab is the only tab stop in the tablist before focus enters the active panel controls. |
| `ArrowRight` | Focused view tab | Select and focus the next view tab, wrapping from Replay to Bundles. |
| `ArrowLeft` | Focused view tab | Select and focus the previous view tab, wrapping from Bundles to Replay. |
| `Home` | Focused view tab | Select and focus Bundles. |
| `End` | Focused view tab | Select and focus Replay. |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Focused view tab | Activate the focused view tab. |
| `Escape` | Keyboard help overlay | Close the overlay and return focus to the Help control. |
| `Escape` | Command palette | Close the palette. |
| `Escape` | Search view | Clear search filters, results, and errors without moving focus. |
| `Escape` | Replay view | Clear replay output and return the replay panel to idle. |
| `Escape` | Bundle comparison panel | Close the comparison panel. |

The current view order is Bundles, History, Unfinished, Memory, Live Feed,
Search, Timeline, and Replay.

## Command palette

`Cmd+K` (macOS) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) opens a lightweight command palette
(`role="dialog"` with a `listbox` of options). Current commands:

- **Focus search** — switch to the Search tab and focus the first filter field.
- **Toggle theme** — switch between light and dark theme.

Arrow keys move the active option; Enter runs it. Escape closes the palette.

## In-app help

Press `?` or choose **Help (?)** in the viewer sidebar to open the keyboard shortcut
overlay. See [`docs/HELP.md`](HELP.md) for a short operator reference.

## Test Evidence

`tests/visual/harness/a11y.spec.js` runs against the built Dioxus web viewer and
covers the ARIA tab keyboard pattern, active-tab tab order, Search
`Escape`-to-clear behavior, keyboard-help open/close via `?` and `Escape`, command
palette open/close via `Ctrl+K` / `Escape`, fixture-driven status regions
(`skeleton`, `loading-long`, `search-error`, `stream-skeleton`), reduced-motion
spinner flattening, and landmark visibility. The same component source backs the desktop viewer,
with native WebView and OS chrome covered by [`docs/a11y/status-regions-and-native-smoke.md`](a11y/status-regions-and-native-smoke.md).
