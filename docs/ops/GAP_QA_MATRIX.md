# Gap audit / QA matrix

This matrix is the human-readable QA view of
[`TRACEABILITY.json`](TRACEABILITY.json). Status values are limited to `done`,
`partial`, `todo`, `blocked`, and `na`. Scores are copied from
[`audit/SCORECARD.md`](../../audit/SCORECARD.md) and MUST NOT be changed without
a re-audit. Agents changing a row must update `status_updated`, the linked WBS
package, and the JSON mirror in the same change.

## PLAN and roadmap residual themes

These are residual themes only; they do not create new PLAN T-IDs.
