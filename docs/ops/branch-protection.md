# Branch protection verification

SessionLedger expects GitHub **branch protection** (or equivalent rulesets) on
`main` so merges require a pull request and signed commits. This document covers
the **machine-verify** path only.

Maintainer **2FA** / org hardware-key policy is **not** asserted here and cannot
be proven from repository contents or this script.

## Maintainer checklist (Settings)

Configure **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → `main`** (or a
repository ruleset targeting `main`):

- [ ] **Require a pull request before merging**
- [ ] **Require signed commits**
- [ ] **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (recommended)
- [ ] **Require status checks to pass** (recommended; pin required jobs)

## Machine verification

[`scripts/branch-protection-check.ps1`](../../scripts/branch-protection-check.ps1)
queries the GitHub REST API via `gh api`:

```text
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection
```

Run locally:

```powershell
# Best-effort: skip (exit 0) when gh/token/admin scope is unavailable
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/branch-protection-check.ps1

# Optional: fail when the API is readable but core controls are missing
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/branch-protection-check.ps1 -Strict
```

### Soft-fail behavior

| Condition | Default exit | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| `gh` missing | 0 (SKIP) | Install GitHub CLI or use CI job |
| No `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `gh auth` missing | 0 (SKIP) | Export a token with admin read on protection |
| HTTP 401/403 (insufficient scope) | 0 (SKIP) | Classic protection API needs admin |
| HTTP 404 "Branch not protected" | 0 (SKIP) | Enable protection; `-Strict` exits 1 |
| API OK, core controls present | 0 (PASS) | Signatures + PR reviews required |
| API OK, core controls missing | 0 soft / 1 with `-Strict` | Docs-only soft path for OSS CI |

Core controls for PASS: **required signatures** and **required pull request
reviews**. `enforce_admins` and required status checks are reported but not
required for the soft PASS.

## CI workflow

[`.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`](../../.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml)
runs the script on path-filtered PRs/pushes and `workflow_dispatch`. The job uses
`continue-on-error` for fork pull requests so missing tokens do not block
contributor CI. On the canonical repo the script itself remains best-effort
unless maintainers pass `-Strict` manually.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` in Actions usually **cannot** read classic branch protection
without elevated permissions; treat CI as advisory evidence that the script runs,
not as proof that Settings are correct.
